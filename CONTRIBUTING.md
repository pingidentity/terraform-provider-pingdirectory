# Contributing to the PingDirectory Terraform Provider

We appreciate your help!  We welcome contributions in the form of creating issues or pull requests.

Know that:

1. If you have any questions, please ask!  We'll help as best we can.
2. While we appreciate perfect PRs, they are not essential. We will fix up any housekeeping changes before merging code.  If we find a PR that needs further work, we will guide you in the right direction.
3. We may not be able to respond quickly; our development cycles are on a priority basis.
4. We base our priorities on customer need and the number of votes on issues/PRs by the number of üëç reactions.  If there is an existing issue or PR for something you would like, please vote!

The following guides are here to help you get started with provider development, logging issues and creating PRs.  Following these guides will enable us to respond quicker and should result in faster PR merges to improve our provider.  Thanks for your cooperation!
