# pingdirectory_change_subscription (Data Source)

Change Subscriptions define sets of criteria for changes of interest for which further processing should be performed. Whenever a change is processed that matches the associated criteria, the change subscription handlers configured in the server will be allowed to perform their associated processing for that operation.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pingdirectory_change_subscription" "myChangeSubscription" {
  name = "MyChangeSubscription"
}
```
