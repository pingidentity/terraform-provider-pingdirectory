# pingdirectory_identity_mappers (Data Source)

Lists Identity Mapper objects in the server configuration.

Identity Mappers are responsible for establishing a mapping between an identifier string provided by a client, and the entry for the user that corresponds to that identifier. Identity Mappers are used to process several SASL mechanisms to map an authorization ID (e.g., a Kerberos principal when using GSSAPI) to a directory user. They are also used when processing requests with the proxied authorization control.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pingdirectory_identity_mappers" "list" {
}
```

## Documentation
See the [PingDirectory documentation](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingdirectory-93/pd_cs_config_identity_mapper)
