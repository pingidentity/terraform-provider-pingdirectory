# pingdirectory_connection_handler (Data Source)

Describes a Connection Handler.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.1"
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      version = "~> 0.3.0"
      source  = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
  product_version        = "9.3.0.0"
}

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of this config object.

### Read-Only

- `accept_backlog` (Number) When the `type` attribute is set to `ldap`: Specifies the maximum number of pending connection attempts that are allowed to queue up in the accept backlog before the server starts rejecting new connection attempts. When the `type` attribute is set to `http`: Specifies the number of concurrent outstanding connection attempts that the connection handler should allow. The default value should be acceptable in most cases, but it may need to be increased in environments that may attempt to establish large numbers of connections simultaneously.
- `allow_ldap_v2` (Boolean) Indicates whether connections from LDAPv2 clients are allowed.
- `allow_start_tls` (Boolean) Indicates whether clients are allowed to use StartTLS.
- `allow_tcp_reuse_address` (Boolean) Indicates whether the server should attempt to reuse socket descriptors. This may be useful in environments with a high rate of connection establishment and termination.
- `allowed_client` (Set of String) Specifies a set of address masks that determines the addresses of the clients that are allowed to establish connections to this connection handler.
- `auto_authenticate_using_client_certificate` (Boolean) Indicates whether to attempt to automatically authenticate a client connection that has established a secure communication channel (using either SSL or StartTLS) and presented its own client certificate. Generally, clients should use the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism to authenticate using a client certificate, but some clients may not support that capability and/or may expect automatic authentication.
- `close_connections_on_explicit_gc` (Boolean) Indicates whether all connections associated with this LDAP Connection Handler should be closed before an explicit garbage collection is performed to allow clients to route requests to another server.
- `close_connections_when_unavailable` (Boolean) Indicates whether all connections associated with this LDAP Connection Handler should be closed and no new connections accepted when the server has determined that it is "unavailable." This allows clients (or a network load balancer) to route requests to another server.
- `correlation_id_request_header` (Set of String) Specifies the set of HTTP request headers that may contain a value to be used as the correlation ID. Example values are "Correlation-Id", "X-Amzn-Trace-Id", and "X-Request-Id".

- `enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the Connection Handler is enabled.
- `failed_bind_response_delay` (String) Specifies the length of time that the server should delay the response to non-successful bind operations. A value of zero milliseconds indicates that non-successful bind operations should not be delayed.
- `http_operation_log_publisher` (Set of String) Specifies the set of HTTP operation loggers that should be used to log information about requests and responses for operations processed through this HTTP Connection Handler.
- `http_request_header_size` (Number) Specifies the maximum buffer size of an http request including the request uri and all of the request headers.
- `http_servlet_extension` (Set of String) Specifies information about servlets that will be provided via this connection handler.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `idle_time_limit` (String) Specifies the maximum idle time for a connection. The max idle time is applied when waiting for a new request to be received on a connection, when reading the headers and content of a request, or when writing the headers and content of a response.
- `keep_stats` (Boolean) Indicates whether to enable statistics collection for this connection handler.
- `key_manager_provider` (String) When the `type` attribute is set to `jmx`: Specifies the name of the key manager that should be used with this JMX Connection Handler . When the `type` attribute is set to `ldap`: Specifies the name of the key manager that should be used with this LDAP Connection Handler . When the `type` attribute is set to `http`: Specifies the key manager provider that will be used to obtain the certificate to present to HTTPS clients.
- `ldif_directory` (String) Specifies the path to the directory in which the LDIF files should be placed.
- `listen_address` (Set of String) When the `type` attribute is set to `ldap`: Specifies the address or set of addresses on which this LDAP Connection Handler should listen for connections from LDAP clients. When the `type` attribute is set to `http`: Specifies the address on which to listen for connections from HTTP clients. If no value is defined, the server will listen on all addresses on all interfaces.
- `listen_port` (Number) When the `type` attribute is set to `jmx`: Specifies the port number on which the JMX Connection Handler will listen for connections from clients. When the `type` attribute is set to `ldap`: Specifies the port number on which the LDAP Connection Handler will listen for connections from clients. When the `type` attribute is set to `http`: Specifies the port number on which the HTTP Connection Handler will listen for connections from clients.
- `low_resources_connection_threshold` (Number) Specifies the number of connections, which if exceeded, places this handler in a low resource state where a different idle time limit is applied on the connections.
- `low_resources_idle_time_limit` (String) Specifies the maximum idle time for a connection when this handler is in a low resource state as defined by low-resource-connections. The max idle time is applied when waiting for a new request to be received on a connection, when reading the headers and content of a request, or when writing the headers and content of a response.
- `max_blocked_write_time_limit` (String) Specifies the maximum length of time that attempts to write data to LDAP clients should be allowed to block.
