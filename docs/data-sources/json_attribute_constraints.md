# pingdirectory_json_attribute_constraints (Data Source)

Describes a Json Attribute Constraints.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.1"
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      version = "~> 0.3.0"
      source  = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
  product_version        = "9.3.0.0"
}

data "pingdirectory_json_attribute_constraints" "myJsonAttributeConstraints" {
  attribute_type = "myattr"
}

## Schema

### Required

- `attribute_type` (String) The name or OID of the LDAP attribute type whose values will be subject to the associated field constraints. This attribute type must be defined in the server schema, and it must have a "JSON object" syntax.

### Read-Only

- `allow_unnamed_fields` (Boolean) Indicates whether JSON objects stored as values of attributes with the associated attribute-type will be permitted to include fields for which there is no subordinate json-field-constraints definition. If unnamed fields are allowed, then no constraints will be imposed on the values of those fields. However, if unnamed fields are not allowed, then the server will reject any attempt to store a JSON object with a field for which there is no corresponding json-fields-constraints definition.
- `description` (String) A description for this JSON Attribute Constraints
- `enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether this JSON Attribute Constraints is enabled.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
