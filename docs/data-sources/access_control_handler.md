# pingdirectory_access_control_handler (Data Source)

Describes a Access Control Handler.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.1"
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      version = "~> 0.3.0"
      source  = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
  product_version        = "9.3.0.0"
}

## Schema

### Read-Only

- `allowed_bind_control` (Set of String) Specifies a set of controls that clients should be allowed to include in bind requests. As bind requests are evaluated as the unauthenticated user, any controls included in this set will be permitted for any bind attempt. If you wish to grant permission for any bind controls not listed here, then the allowed-bind-control-oid property may be used to accomplish that.
- `allowed_bind_control_oid` (Set of String) Specifies the OIDs of any additional controls (not covered by the allowed-bind-control property) that should be permitted in bind requests.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether this Access Control Handler is enabled. If set to FALSE, then no access control is enforced, and any client (including unauthenticated or anonymous clients) could be allowed to perform any operation if not subject to other restrictions, such as those enforced by the privilege subsystem.
- `global_aci` (Set of String) Defines global access control rules.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `type` (String) The type of Access Control Handler resource. Options are ['dsee-compat']
