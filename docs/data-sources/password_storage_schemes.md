# pingdirectory_password_storage_schemes (Data Source)

Lists Password Storage Scheme objects in the server configuration.

Password Storage Schemes encode new passwords provided by users so that they are stored in an encoded manner. This makes it difficult or impossible for someone to determine the clear-text passwords from the encoded values.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pingdirectory_password_storage_schemes" "list" {
}
```

## Documentation
See the [PingDirectory documentation](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingdirectory-93/pd_sec_password_storage_schemes)
