# pingdirectory_log_file_rotation_listener (Data Source)

Describes a Log File Rotation Listener.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.1"
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      version = "~> 0.3.0"
      source  = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
  product_version        = "9.3.0.0"
}

  name = "MyLogFileRotationListener"

- `extension_class` (String) The fully-qualified name of the Java class providing the logic for the Third Party Log File Rotation Listener.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `output_directory` (String) The path to the directory in which the summarize-access-log output should be written. If no value is provided, the output file will be written into the same directory as the rotated log file.
