# pingdirectory_log_file_rotation_listener (Data Source)

Describes a Log File Rotation Listener.

Log File Rotation Listeners allow the server to take some action whenever a log file is rotated out of service so that the server will start writing to a new file. Log File Rotation Listeners must not delete, move, rename, or otherwise alter rotated log files in any way.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pingdirectory_log_file_rotation_listener" "myLogFileRotationListener" {
  name = "MyLogFileRotationListener"
}
```

## Documentation
See the [PingDirectory documentation](https://docs.pingidentity.com/r/en-us/pingdirectory-93/pd_ds_config_log_rotation_listeners?tocId=lWywrDXSdkcjHnzEpt4LmA)
