The SASL mechanism handler configuration entry is the parent for all SASL mechanism handlers defined in the Directory Server.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "pingdirectory_sasl_mechanism_handler" "mySaslMechanismHandler" {
  name = "MySaslMechanismHandler"
}
```

If no value is specified, then the mapper specified in the identity-mapper configuration property will be used.
- `any_required_scope` (Set of String) The set of OAuth scopes that a token may have to be allowed for authentication.
- `certificate_attribute` (String) Specifies the name of the attribute to hold user certificates.

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `id_token_validator` (Set of String) An ID token validator that will ensure that each presented OpenID Connect ID token is authentic and trustworthy, and that will map the token to a local entry.
- `identity_mapper` (String) When the `type` attribute is set to:
  - One of [`unboundid-totp`, `unboundid-yubikey-otp`, `unboundid-delivered-otp`]: The identity mapper that should be used to identify the user(s) targeted in the authentication and/or authorization identities contained in the bind request. This will only be used for "u:"-style identities.
  - One of [`digest-md5`, `plain`]: Specifies the name of the identity mapper that is to be used with this SASL mechanism handler to match the authentication or authorization ID included in the SASL bind request to the corresponding user in the directory.
  - `unboundid-ms-chap-v2`: The identity mapper that should be used to identify the entry associated with the username provided in the bind request.
  - `unboundid-external-auth`: The identity mapper that should be used to identify the user targeted by the authentication ID contained in the bind request. This will only be used for "u:"-style authentication ID values.
  - `cram-md5`: Specifies the name of the identity mapper used with this SASL mechanism handler to match the authentication ID included in the SASL bind request to the corresponding user in the directory.
  - `gssapi`: Specifies the name of the identity mapper that is to be used with this SASL mechanism handler to match the Kerberos principal included in the SASL bind request to the corresponding user in the directory.
  - `third-party`: The identity mapper that may be used to map usernames to user entries. If the custom SASL mechanism involves a username or some other form of authentication and/or authorization identity, then this may be used to map that ID to an entry for that user.
- `jaas_config_file` (String) Specifies the path to a JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) configuration file that provides the information that the JVM should use for Kerberos processing.
- `kdc_address` (String) Specifies the address of the KDC that is to be used for Kerberos processing.
- `kerberos_service_principal` (String) Specifies the Kerberos service principal that the Directory Server will use to identify itself to the KDC.
- `key_manager_provider` (String) Specifies which key manager provider should be used to obtain a client certificate to present to the validation server when performing HTTPS communication. This may be left undefined if communication will not be secured with HTTPS, or if there is no need to present a client certificate to the validation service.
- `keytab` (String) Specifies the keytab file that should be used for Kerberos processing.
- `otp_validity_duration` (String) The maximum length of time that a one-time password value should be considered valid.
- `prevent_totp_reuse` (Boolean) Indicates whether to prevent clients from re-using TOTP passwords.
- `realm` (String) When the `type` attribute is set to:

- `trust_manager_provider` (String) Specifies which trust manager provider should be used to determine whether to trust the certificate presented by the server when performing HTTPS communication. This may be left undefined if HTTPS communication is not needed, or if the validation service presents a certificate that is trusted by the default JVM configuration (which should be the case for the validation servers that Yubico provides, but may not be the case if an alternate validation server is configured).
- `type` (String) The type of SASL Mechanism Handler resource. Options are ['unboundid-ms-chap-v2', 'unboundid-totp', 'unboundid-yubikey-otp', 'external', 'digest-md5', 'plain', 'unboundid-delivered-otp', 'unboundid-external-auth', 'anonymous', 'cram-md5', 'oauth-bearer', 'unboundid-certificate-plus-password', 'gssapi', 'third-party']

- `yubikey_client_id` (String) The client ID to include in requests to the YubiKey validation server. A client ID and API key may be obtained for free from https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/.
- `yubikey_validation_server_base_url` (Set of String) The base URL of the validation server to use to verify one-time passwords. You should only need to change the value if you wish to use your own validation server instead of using one of the Yubico servers. The server must use the YubiKey Validation Protocol version 2.0.
