## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of this config object.
- `server_instance_name` (String) Name of the parent Server Instance

### Read-Only

- `cipher_transformation_name` (String) The algorithm name used to produce this cipher, e.g. AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `initialization_vector_length_bits` (Number) The initialization vector length of the cipher in bits.
- `is_compromised` (Boolean) If the key is compromised, an administrator may set this flag to immediately trigger the creation of a new secret key. After the new key is generated, the value of this property will be reset to false.
- `key_id` (String) The unique system-generated identifier for the Secret Key.
- `key_length_bits` (Number) The length of the key in bits.
- `symmetric_key` (Set of String) The symmetric key that is used for both encryption of plain text and decryption of cipher text. This stores the secret key for each server instance encrypted with that server's inter-server certificate.
- `type` (String) The type of Cipher Secret Key resource. Options are ['cipher-secret-key']
