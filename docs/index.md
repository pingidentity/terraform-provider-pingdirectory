# PingDirectory Provider

The PingDirectory provider manages the configuration of a PingDirectory server through the Configuration API. The provider only manages configuration, similar to the `dsconfig` command-line tool. The provider does not manage other aspects of the PingDirectory server, such as schema and user data.

The Configuration API requires credentials for basic auth, which must be passed to the provider.

## Schema

### Optional

- `ca_certificate_pem_files` (Set of String) Paths to files containing PEM-encoded certificates to be trusted as root CAs when connecting to the PingDirectory server over HTTPS. If not set, the host's root CA set will be used. Default value can be set with the `PINGDIRECTORY_PROVIDER_CA_CERTIFICATE_PEM_FILES` environment variable, using commas to delimit multiple PEM files if necessary.
- `https_host` (String) URI for PingDirectory HTTPS port. Default value can be set with the `PINGDIRECTORY_PROVIDER_HTTPS_HOST` environment variable.
- `insecure_trust_all_tls` (Boolean) Set to true to trust any certificate when connecting to the PingDirectory server. This is insecure and should not be enabled outside of testing. Default value can be set with the `PINGDIRECTORY_PROVIDER_INSECURE_TRUST_ALL_TLS` environment variable.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for PingDirectory admin user. Default value can be set with the `PINGDIRECTORY_PROVIDER_PASSWORD` environment variable.
- `username` (String) Username for PingDirectory admin user. Default value can be set with the `PINGDIRECTORY_PROVIDER_USERNAME` environment variable.

## Server profile examples

Examples duplicating behavior of existing [server profiles](https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-server-profiles) can be found in the `examples/server-profiles` directory.

## An example managing several config objects

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      source = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
}

# Disable the default failed operations access logger
resource "pingdirectory_default_file_based_access_log_publisher" "defaultFileBasedAccessLogPublisher" {
  id      = "Failed Operations Access Logger"
  enabled = true
}

# Create a custom file based access logger
resource "pingdirectory_file_based_access_log_publisher" "myNewFileBasedAccessLogPublisher" {
  id                   = "MyNewFileBasedAccessLogPublisher"
  log_file             = "logs/example.log"
  log_file_permissions = "600"
  rotation_policy      = ["Size Limit Rotation Policy"]
  retention_policy     = ["File Count Retention Policy"]
  asynchronous         = true
  enabled              = false
}

# Enable the default JMX connection handler
resource "pingdirectory_default_jmx_connection_handler" "defaultJmxConnHandler" {
  id      = "JMX Connection Handler"
  enabled = false
}

# Create a custom JMX connection handler
