# pingdirectory_aggregate_request_criteria (Resource)

Manages a Aggregate Request Criteria.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.1"
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      version = "~> 0.3.0"
      source  = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
  product_version        = "9.2.0.0"
}

# Use "pingdirectory_default_aggregate_request_criteria" if you are adopting existing configuration from the PingDirectory server into Terraform
resource "pingdirectory_aggregate_request_criteria" "myAggregateRequestCriteria" {
  id = "MyAggregateRequestCriteria"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Name of this object.

### Optional

- `all_included_request_criteria` (Set of String) Specifies a request criteria object that must match the associated operation request in order to match the aggregate request criteria. If one or more all-included request criteria objects are provided, then an operation request must match all of them in order to match the aggregate request criteria.
- `any_included_request_criteria` (Set of String) Specifies a request criteria object that may match the associated operation request in order to the this aggregate request criteria. If one or more any-included request criteria objects are provided, then an operation request must match at least one of them in order to match the aggregate request criteria.
- `description` (String) A description for this Request Criteria
- `none_included_request_criteria` (Set of String) Specifies a request criteria object that must not match the associated operation request in order to match the aggregate request criteria. If one or more none-included request criteria objects are provided, then an operation request must not match any of them in order to match the aggregate request criteria.
- `not_all_included_request_criteria` (Set of String) Specifies a request criteria object that should not match the associated operation request in order to match the aggregate request criteria. If one or more not-all-included request criteria objects are provided, then an operation request must not match all of them (that is, it may match zero or more of them, but it must not match all of them) in order to match the aggregate request criteria.
