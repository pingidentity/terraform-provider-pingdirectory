<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of this config object.

### Optional

- `accept_backlog` (Number) Specifies the maximum number of pending connection attempts that are allowed to queue up in the accept backlog before the server starts rejecting new connection attempts.
- `allow_ldap_v2` (Boolean) Indicates whether connections from LDAPv2 clients are allowed.
- `allow_start_tls` (Boolean) Indicates whether clients are allowed to use StartTLS.
- `allow_tcp_reuse_address` (Boolean) Indicates whether the server should attempt to reuse socket descriptors. This may be useful in environments with a high rate of connection establishment and termination.
- `allowed_client` (Set of String) Specifies a set of address masks that determines the addresses of the clients that are allowed to establish connections to this connection handler.
- `auto_authenticate_using_client_certificate` (Boolean) Indicates whether to attempt to automatically authenticate a client connection that has established a secure communication channel (using either SSL or StartTLS) and presented its own client certificate. Generally, clients should use the SASL EXTERNAL mechanism to authenticate using a client certificate, but some clients may not support that capability and/or may expect automatic authentication.
- `close_connections_on_explicit_gc` (Boolean) Indicates whether all connections associated with this LDAP Connection Handler should be closed before an explicit garbage collection is performed to allow clients to route requests to another server.
- `close_connections_when_unavailable` (Boolean) Indicates whether all connections associated with this LDAP Connection Handler should be closed and no new connections accepted when the server has determined that it is "unavailable." This allows clients (or a network load balancer) to route requests to another server.
- `correlation_id_request_header` (Set of String) Specifies the set of HTTP request headers that may contain a value to be used as the correlation ID. Example values are "Correlation-Id", "X-Amzn-Trace-Id", and "X-Request-Id".
- `correlation_id_response_header` (String) Specifies the name of the HTTP response header that will contain a correlation ID value. Example values are "Correlation-Id", "X-Amzn-Trace-Id", and "X-Request-Id".
- `denied_client` (Set of String) Specifies a set of address masks that determines the addresses of the clients that are not allowed to establish connections to this connection handler.
- `description` (String) A description for this Connection Handler
- `enable_multipart_mime_parameters` (Boolean) Determines whether request form parameters submitted in multipart/ form-data (RFC 2388) format should be processed as request parameters.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the Connection Handler is enabled.
- `failed_bind_response_delay` (String) Specifies the length of time that the server should delay the response to non-successful bind operations. A value of zero milliseconds indicates that non-successful bind operations should not be delayed.
- `http_operation_log_publisher` (Set of String) Specifies the set of HTTP operation loggers that should be used to log information about requests and responses for operations processed through this HTTP Connection Handler.
- `http_request_header_size` (Number) Specifies the maximum buffer size of an http request including the request uri and all of the request headers.
- `http_servlet_extension` (Set of String) Specifies information about servlets that will be provided via this connection handler.
- `idle_time_limit` (String) Specifies the maximum idle time for a connection. The max idle time is applied when waiting for a new request to be received on a connection, when reading the headers and content of a request, or when writing the headers and content of a response.
- `keep_stats` (Boolean) Indicates whether to enable statistics collection for this connection handler.
- `key_manager_provider` (String) Specifies the name of the key manager that should be used with this JMX Connection Handler .
- `ldif_directory` (String) Specifies the path to the directory in which the LDIF files should be placed.
- `listen_address` (Set of String) Specifies the address or set of addresses on which this LDAP Connection Handler should listen for connections from LDAP clients.
- `listen_port` (Number) Specifies the port number on which the JMX Connection Handler will listen for connections from clients.
- `low_resources_connection_threshold` (Number) Specifies the number of connections, which if exceeded, places this handler in a low resource state where a different idle time limit is applied on the connections.
- `low_resources_idle_time_limit` (String) Specifies the maximum idle time for a connection when this handler is in a low resource state as defined by low-resource-connections. The max idle time is applied when waiting for a new request to be received on a connection, when reading the headers and content of a request, or when writing the headers and content of a response.
- `max_blocked_write_time_limit` (String) Specifies the maximum length of time that attempts to write data to LDAP clients should be allowed to block.
- `max_cancel_handlers` (Number) Specifies the maximum number of threads that are used to process cancel and abandon requests from clients.
- `max_request_size` (String) Specifies the size of the largest LDAP request message that will be allowed by this LDAP Connection handler.
- `num_accept_handlers` (Number) Specifies the number of threads that are used to accept new client connections, and to perform any initial preparation on those connections that may be needed before the connection can be used to read requests and send responses.
- `num_request_handlers` (Number) Specifies the number of request handlers that are used to read requests from clients.
- `poll_interval` (String) Specifies how frequently the LDIF connection handler should check the LDIF directory to determine whether a new LDIF file has been added.
- `response_header` (Set of String) Specifies HTTP header fields and values added to response headers for all requests.
- `send_rejection_notice` (Boolean) Indicates whether the LDAP Connection Handler should send a notice of disconnection extended response message to the client if a new connection is rejected for some reason.
- `ssl_cert_nickname` (String) Specifies the nickname (also called the alias) of the certificate that the JMX Connection Handler should use when performing SSL communication.
- `ssl_cipher_suite` (Set of String) Specifies the names of the TLS cipher suites that are allowed for use in SSL or StartTLS communication. The set of supported cipher suites can be viewed via the ssl context monitor entry.
- `ssl_client_auth_policy` (String) Specifies the policy that the LDAP Connection Handler should use regarding client SSL certificates.
- `ssl_protocol` (Set of String) Specifies the names of the TLS protocols that are allowed for use in SSL or StartTLS communication. The set of supported ssl protocols can be viewed via the ssl context monitor entry.
- `trust_manager_provider` (String) Specifies the name of the trust manager that should be used with the LDAP Connection Handler .
- `use_correlation_id_header` (Boolean) If enabled, a correlation ID header will be added to outgoing HTTP responses.
- `use_forwarded_headers` (Boolean) Indicates whether to use "Forwarded" and "X-Forwarded-*" request headers to override corresponding HTTP request information available during request processing.
- `use_ssl` (Boolean) Indicates whether the JMX Connection Handler should use SSL.
- `use_tcp_keep_alive` (Boolean) Indicates whether the LDAP Connection Handler should use TCP keep-alive.
- `web_application_extension` (Set of String) Specifies information about web applications that will be provided via this connection handler.
