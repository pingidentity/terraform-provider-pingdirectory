# pingdirectory_default_json_attribute_constraints (Resource)

Manages a Json Attribute Constraints.

JSON Attribute Constraints may be used to specify a number of properties and constraints for JSON objects to be stored in attributes with a "JSON object" syntax. Each JSON Attribute Constraints definition will be associated with a set of json-field-constraints definitions that can collectively define a complete or partial schema for the JSON objects, and may also provide additional information about the way the server should treat those fields (e.g., whether any of the fields should be indexed for faster searching, or have their values tokenized for more compact storage).

Since this is a 'default' resource, the managed object must already exist in the PingDirectory configuration.

## Schema

### Required

- `attribute_type` (String) The name or OID of the LDAP attribute type whose values will be subject to the associated field constraints. This attribute type must be defined in the server schema, and it must have a "JSON object" syntax.

### Optional

- `allow_unnamed_fields` (Boolean) Indicates whether JSON objects stored as values of attributes with the associated attribute-type will be permitted to include fields for which there is no subordinate json-field-constraints definition. If unnamed fields are allowed, then no constraints will be imposed on the values of those fields. However, if unnamed fields are not allowed, then the server will reject any attempt to store a JSON object with a field for which there is no corresponding json-fields-constraints definition.
- `description` (String) A description for this JSON Attribute Constraints
- `enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether this JSON Attribute Constraints is enabled.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `notifications` (Set of String) Notifications returned by the PingDirectory Configuration API.
- `required_actions` (Set of Object) Required actions returned by the PingDirectory Configuration API. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--required_actions))
- `type` (String) The type of JSON Attribute Constraints resource. Options are ['json-attribute-constraints']
