### Optional

- `allow_unnamed_fields` (Boolean) Indicates whether JSON objects stored as values of attributes with the associated attribute-type will be permitted to include fields for which there is no subordinate json-field-constraints definition. If unnamed fields are allowed, then no constraints will be imposed on the values of those fields.
