# pingdirectory_default_dn_map (Resource)

Manages a Dn Map.

A DN Map constructs DN values from attributes and the DN of a source entry, and fixed text. It is used to construct the DN for an entry as well as values for attributes that store DNs such as isMemberOf.

Since this is a 'default' resource, the managed object must already exist in the PingDirectory configuration.
