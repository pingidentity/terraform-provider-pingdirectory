# pingdirectory_third_party_alert_handler (Resource)

Manages a Third Party Alert Handler.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.1"
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      version = "~> 0.3.0"
      source  = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
  product_version        = "9.2.0.0"
}

resource "pingdirectory_third_party_alert_handler" "myThirdPartyAlertHandler" {
  id              = "MyThirdPartyAlertHandler"
  extension_class = "com.example.myclass"
  enabled         = false
}
```

- `extension_class` (String) The fully-qualified name of the Java class providing the logic for the Third Party Alert Handler.
- `id` (String) Name of this object.

### Optional

- `asynchronous` (Boolean) Indicates whether the server should attempt to invoke this Alert Handler in a background thread so that any potentially-expensive processing (e.g., performing network communication to deliver the alert notification) will not delay whatever processing the server was performing when the alert was generated.
- `description` (String) A description for this Alert Handler
- `disabled_alert_type` (Set of String) Specifies the names of the alert types that are disabled for this alert handler.
- `enabled_alert_severity` (Set of String) Specifies the alert severities for which this alert handler should be used. If no values are provided, then this alert handler will be enabled for alerts with any severity.
- `enabled_alert_type` (Set of String) Specifies the names of the alert types that are enabled for this alert handler.
- `extension_argument` (Set of String) The set of arguments used to customize the behavior for the Third Party Alert Handler. Each configuration property should be given in the form 'name=value'.
