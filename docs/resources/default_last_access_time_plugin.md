# pingdirectory_default_last_access_time_plugin (Resource)

Manages a Last Access Time Plugin.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.1"
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      source = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
}

resource "pingdirectory_default_last_access_time_plugin" "myLastAccessTimePlugin" {
  id      = "Last Access Time"
  enabled = false
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Name of this object.

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description for this Plugin
- `enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the plug-in is enabled for use.
- `invoke_for_failed_binds` (Boolean) Indicates whether to update the last access time for an entry targeted by a bind operation if the bind is unsuccessful.
- `invoke_for_internal_operations` (Boolean) Indicates whether the plug-in should be invoked for internal operations.
- `max_search_result_entries_to_update` (Number) Specifies the maximum number of entries that should be updated in a search operation. Only search result entries actually returned to the client may have their last access time updated, but because a single search operation may return a very large number of entries, the plugin will only update entries if no more than a specified number of entries are updated.
- `max_update_frequency` (String) Specifies the maximum frequency with which last access time values should be written for an entry. This may help limit the rate of internal write operations processed in the server.
- `operation_type` (Set of String) Specifies the types of operations that should result in access time updates.
- `request_criteria` (String) Specifies a set of request criteria that may be used to indicate whether to apply access time updates for the associated operation.

### Read-Only

- `last_updated` (String) Timestamp of the last Terraform update of this resource.
- `notifications` (Set of String) Notifications returned by the PingDirectory Configuration API.
- `required_actions` (Set of Object) Required actions returned by the PingDirectory Configuration API. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--required_actions))

## Import
