# pingdirectory_log_file_rotation_listener (Resource)

Manages a Log File Rotation Listener.

Log File Rotation Listeners allow the server to take some action whenever a log file is rotated out of service so that the server will start writing to a new file. Log File Rotation Listeners must not delete, move, rename, or otherwise alter rotated log files in any way.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingdirectory_log_file_rotation_listener" "myLogFileRotationListener" {
  name             = "MyLogFileRotationListener"
  type             = "summarize"
  description      = "My summarize log file rotation listener"
  enabled          = true
  output_directory = "/tmp"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the Log File Rotation Listener is enabled for use.
- `name` (String) Name of this config object.
- `type` (String) The type of Log File Rotation Listener resource. Options are ['summarize', 'copy', 'third-party']

### Optional

- `compress_on_copy` (Boolean) Indicates whether the file should be gzip-compressed as it is copied into the destination directory.
- `copy_to_directory` (String) The path to the directory to which log files should be copied. It must be different from the directory to which the log file is originally written, and administrators should ensure that the filesystem has sufficient space to hold files as they are copied.
- `description` (String) A description for this Log File Rotation Listener
- `extension_argument` (Set of String) The set of arguments used to customize the behavior for the Third Party Log File Rotation Listener. Each configuration property should be given in the form 'name=value'.
- `extension_class` (String) The fully-qualified name of the Java class providing the logic for the Third Party Log File Rotation Listener.
- `output_directory` (String) The path to the directory in which the summarize-access-log output should be written. If no value is provided, the output file will be written into the same directory as the rotated log file.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `notifications` (Set of String) Notifications returned by the PingDirectory Configuration API.
- `required_actions` (Set of Object) Required actions returned by the PingDirectory Configuration API. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--required_actions))
