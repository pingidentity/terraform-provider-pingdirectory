# pingdirectory_default_local_db_vlv_index (Resource)

Manages a Local Db Vlv Index.

Local DB VLV Indexes are used to store information about a specific search request that makes it possible to efficiently process them using the VLV control.

Since this is a 'default' resource, the managed object must already exist in the PingDirectory configuration.
