# pingdirectory_default_change_subscription (Resource)

Manages a Change Subscription.

Change Subscriptions define sets of criteria for changes of interest for which further processing should be performed. Whenever a change is processed that matches the associated criteria, the change subscription handlers configured in the server will be allowed to perform their associated processing for that operation.

Since this is a 'default' resource, the managed object must already exist in the PingDirectory configuration.
