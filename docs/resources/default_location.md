# pingdirectory_default_location (Resource)

Manages a Location.

Locations are used to define collections of servers which may have similar performance characteristics when accessed from this Directory Server. For example, a separate Location may be defined for each data center.

Since this is a 'default' resource, the managed object must already exist in the PingDirectory configuration.
