# pingdirectory_snmp_alert_handler (Resource)

Manages a Snmp Alert Handler.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.1"
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      version = "~> 0.3.0"
      source  = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
  product_version        = "9.2.0.0"
}

resource "pingdirectory_snmp_alert_handler" "mySnmpAlertHandler" {
  id               = "MySnmpAlertHandler"
  server_host_name = "example.com"
  enabled          = false
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the Alert Handler is enabled.
- `id` (String) Name of this object.
- `server_host_name` (String) Specifies the address of the SNMP agent to which traps will be sent.

### Optional

- `asynchronous` (Boolean) Indicates whether the server should attempt to invoke this SNMP Alert Handler in a background thread so that any potentially-expensive processing (e.g., performing network communication to deliver the alert notification) will not delay whatever processing the server was performing when the alert was generated.
- `community_name` (String) Specifies the name of the community to which the traps will be sent.
- `description` (String) A description for this Alert Handler
- `disabled_alert_type` (Set of String) Specifies the names of the alert types that are disabled for this alert handler.
- `enabled_alert_severity` (Set of String) Specifies the alert severities for which this alert handler should be used. If no values are provided, then this alert handler will be enabled for alerts with any severity.
- `enabled_alert_type` (Set of String) Specifies the names of the alert types that are enabled for this alert handler.
- `server_port` (Number) Specifies the port number of the SNMP agent to which traps will be sent.
