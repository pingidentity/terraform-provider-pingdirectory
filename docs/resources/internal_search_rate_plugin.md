# pingdirectory_internal_search_rate_plugin (Resource)

Manages a Internal Search Rate Plugin.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.1"
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      source = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
}

# Use "pingdirectory_default_internal_search_rate_plugin" if you are adopting existing configuration from the PingDirectory server into Terraform
resource "pingdirectory_internal_search_rate_plugin" "myInternalSearchRatePlugin" {
  id            = "MyInternalSearchRatePlugin"
  plugin_type   = ["shutdown", "startup"]
  num_threads   = 10
  base_dn       = "dc=example,dc=com"
  filter_prefix = "myprefix"
  enabled       = true
}
```
