- `enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the Key Manager Provider is enabled for use.
- `extension_argument` (Set of String) The set of arguments used to customize the behavior for the Third Party Key Manager Provider. Each configuration property should be given in the form 'name=value'.
- `extension_class` (String) The fully-qualified name of the Java class providing the logic for the Third Party Key Manager Provider.
- `key_store_file` (String) Specifies the path to the file that contains the private key information. This may be an absolute path, or a path that is relative to the Directory Server instance root.
- `key_store_pin` (String, Sensitive) When the `type` attribute is set to `file-based`: Specifies the PIN needed to access the File Based Key Manager Provider. When the `type` attribute is set to `pkcs11`: Specifies the PIN needed to access the PKCS11 Key Manager Provider.
- `key_store_pin_file` (String) When the `type` attribute is set to `file-based`: Specifies the path to the text file whose only contents should be a single line containing the clear-text PIN needed to access the File Based Key Manager Provider. When the `type` attribute is set to `pkcs11`: Specifies the path to the text file whose only contents should be a single line containing the clear-text PIN needed to access the PKCS11 Key Manager Provider.
- `key_store_pin_passphrase_provider` (String) When the `type` attribute is set to `file-based`: The passphrase provider to use to obtain the clear-text PIN needed to access the File Based Key Manager Provider. When the `type` attribute is set to `pkcs11`: The passphrase provider to use to obtain the clear-text PIN needed to access the PKCS11 Key Manager Provider.
- `key_store_type` (String) Specifies the format for the data in the key store file.
- `pkcs11_key_store_type` (String) The key store type to use when obtaining an instance of a key store for interacting with a PKCS #11 token.

- `private_key_pin_file` (String) Specifies the path to the text file whose only contents should be a single line containing the clear-text PIN needed to access the File Based Key Manager Provider private key. If no private key PIN is specified the PIN defaults to the key store PIN.
- `private_key_pin_passphrase_provider` (String) The passphrase provider to use to obtain the clear-text PIN needed to access the File Based Key Manager Provider private key. If no private key PIN is specified the PIN defaults to the key store PIN.
