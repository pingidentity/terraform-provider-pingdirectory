# pingdirectory_plugin (Resource)

Manages a Plugin.

Plugins provide a mechanism for executing custom code at specified points in operation processing and in the course of other events like connection establishment and termination, server startup and shutdown, and LDIF import and export.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingdirectory_plugin" "myPlugin" {
  name            = "MyPlugin"
  resource_type   = "third-party"
  enabled         = false
  extension_class = "com.Example"
}
```

- `agentx_address` (String) The hostname or IP address of the SNMP master agent.
- `agentx_port` (Number) The port number on which the SNMP master agent will be contacted.
- `allow_lax_pass_through_authentication_passwords` (Boolean) When the `type` attribute is set to:
  - `ping-one-pass-through-authentication`: Indicates whether to overwrite the user's local password even if the password used to authenticate to the PingOne service would have failed validation if the user attempted to set it directly.
  - `pass-through-authentication`: Indicates whether updates to the local password value should accept passwords that do not meet password policy constraints.
  - `pluggable-pass-through-authentication`: Indicates whether to overwrite the user's local password even if the password used to authenticate to the external service would have failed validation if the user attempted to set it directly.
- `allowed_request_control` (Set of String) Specifies the OIDs of the controls that are allowed to be present in operations to coalesce. These controls are passed through when the request is validated, but they will not be included when the background thread applies the coalesced modify requests.
- `always_map_responses` (Boolean) When the `type` attribute is set to:
  - `dn-mapper`: Indicates whether DNs in response messages containing the target DN should always be remapped back to the source DN.

Otherwise, the mapping will be performed for all responses regardless of whether the mapping was applied to the request.
  - `attribute-mapper`: Indicates whether the target attribute in response messages should always be remapped back to the source attribute. If this is "false", then the mapping will be performed for a response message only if one or more elements of the associated request are mapped.

  - `internal-search-rate`: Specifies the base DN to use for the searches to perform.

- `bind_dn_pattern` (String) A pattern to use to construct the bind DN for the simple bind request to send to the remote server. This may consist of a combination of static text and attribute values and other directives enclosed in curly braces.  For example, the value "cn={cn},ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" indicates that the remote bind DN should be constructed from the text "cn=" followed by the value of the local entry's cn attribute followed by the text "ou=People,dc=example,dc=com". If an attribute contains the value to use as the bind DN for pass-through authentication, then the pattern may simply be the name of that attribute in curly braces (e.g., if the seeAlso attribute contains the bind DN for the target user, then a bind DN pattern of "{seeAlso}" would be appropriate).  Note that a bind DN pattern can be used to construct a bind DN that is not actually a valid LDAP distinguished name. For example, if authentication is being passed through to a Microsoft Active Directory server, then a bind DN pattern could be used to construct a user principal name (UPN) as an alternative to a distinguished name.

  - `ping-one-pass-through-authentication`: This is the DN of the user that will be used to overwrite the user's local password if update-local-password is set. The DN put here should be added to 'ignore-changes-by-dn' in the appropriate Sync Source.
  - `pluggable-pass-through-authentication`: The DN of the authorization identity that will be used when updating the user's local password if update-local-password is true. This is primarily intended for use if the Data Sync Server will be used to synchronize passwords between the local server and the external service, and in that case, the DN used here should also be added to the ignore-changes-by-dn property in the appropriate Sync Source object in the Data Sync Server configuration.
- `update_source_attribute_behavior` (String) The behavior to exhibit for modify and modify DN operations that update one or more of the source attributes used in any of the value patterns.
- `update_target_attribute_behavior` (String) The behavior to exhibit for modify and modify DN operations that attempt to update the set of values for the target attribute.
- `updated_entry_newly_matches_criteria_behavior` (String) The behavior to exhibit for modify or modify DN operations that update an entry that previously did not satisfy either the base DN or filter criteria, but now do satisfy that criteria.
- `updated_entry_no_longer_matches_criteria_behavior` (String) The behavior to exhibit for modify or modify DN operations that update an entry that previously satisfied the base DN and filter criteria, but now no longer satisfies that criteria.
