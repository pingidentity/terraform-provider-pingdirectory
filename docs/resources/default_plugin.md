### Optional

- `additional_user_mapping_scim_filter` (String) An optional SCIM filter that will be ANDed with the filter created to identify the account in the PingOne service that corresponds to the local entry. Only the "eq", "sw", "and", and "or" filter types may be used.
- `agentx_address` (String) The hostname or IP address of the SNMP master agent.
- `agentx_port` (Number) The port number on which the SNMP master agent will be contacted.
- `allow_lax_pass_through_authentication_passwords` (Boolean) When the `type` attribute is set to:
  - `ping-one-pass-through-authentication`: Indicates whether to overwrite the user's local password even if the password used to authenticate to the PingOne service would have failed validation if the user attempted to set it directly.
  - `pass-through-authentication`: Indicates whether updates to the local password value should accept passwords that do not meet password policy constraints.
  - `pluggable-pass-through-authentication`: Indicates whether to overwrite the user's local password even if the password used to authenticate to the external service would have failed validation if the user attempted to set it directly.
- `allowed_request_control` (Set of String) Specifies the OIDs of the controls that are allowed to be present in operations to coalesce. These controls are passed through when the request is validated, but they will not be included when the background thread applies the coalesced modify requests.
- `always_map_responses` (Boolean) When the `type` attribute is set to:
  - `dn-mapper`: Indicates whether DNs in response messages containing the target DN should always be remapped back to the source DN. If this is "false", then mapping will be performed for a response message only if one or more elements of the associated request are mapped. Otherwise, the mapping will be performed for all responses regardless of whether the mapping was applied to the request.
  - `attribute-mapper`: Indicates whether the target attribute in response messages should always be remapped back to the source attribute. If this is "false", then the mapping will be performed for a response message only if one or more elements of the associated request are mapped. Otherwise, the mapping will be performed for all responses regardless of whether the mapping was applied to the request.
- `api_url` (String) Specifies the API endpoint for the PingOne web service.

- `bind_dn_pattern` (String) A pattern to use to construct the bind DN for the simple bind request to send to the remote server. This may consist of a combination of static text and attribute values and other directives enclosed in curly braces.  For example, the value "cn={cn},ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" indicates that the remote bind DN should be constructed from the text "cn=" followed by the value of the local entry's cn attribute followed by the text "ou=People,dc=example,dc=com". If an attribute contains the value to use as the bind DN for pass-through authentication, then the pattern may simply be the name of that attribute in curly braces (e.g., if the seeAlso attribute contains the bind DN for the target user, then a bind DN pattern of "{seeAlso}" would be appropriate).  Note that a bind DN pattern can be used to construct a bind DN that is not actually a valid LDAP distinguished name. For example, if authentication is being passed through to a Microsoft Active Directory server, then a bind DN pattern could be used to construct a user principal name (UPN) as an alternative to a distinguished name.

  - `pass-through-authentication`: Indicates whether the bind attempt should first be attempted against the local server. Depending on the value of the override-local-password property, the bind attempt may then be attempted against a remote server if the local bind fails.
  - `pluggable-pass-through-authentication`: Indicates whether to attempt the bind in the local server first and only send the request to the external authentication service if the local bind attempt fails, or to only attempt the bind in the external service.
- `type` (Set of String) Specifies the type of attributes to check for value uniqueness.
- `update_interval` (String) Specifies the interval in seconds when referential integrity updates are made.
- `update_local_password` (Boolean) When the `type` attribute is set to:
  - `ping-one-pass-through-authentication`: Indicates whether to overwrite the user's local password if the local bind fails but the authentication attempt succeeds when attempted in the PingOne service.
  - `pass-through-authentication`: Indicates whether the local password value should be updated to the value used in the bind request in the event that the local bind fails but the remote bind succeeds.
  - `pluggable-pass-through-authentication`: Indicates whether to overwrite the user's local password if the local bind fails but the authentication attempt succeeds when attempted in the external service. This property may only be set to true if try-local-bind is also true.
- `update_local_password_dn` (String) When the `type` attribute is set to:
  - `ping-one-pass-through-authentication`: This is the DN of the user that will be used to overwrite the user's local password if update-local-password is set. The DN put here should be added to 'ignore-changes-by-dn' in the appropriate Sync Source.
  - `pluggable-pass-through-authentication`: The DN of the authorization identity that will be used when updating the user's local password if update-local-password is true. This is primarily intended for use if the Data Sync Server will be used to synchronize passwords between the local server and the external service, and in that case, the DN used here should also be added to the ignore-changes-by-dn property in the appropriate Sync Source object in the Data Sync Server configuration.
- `update_source_attribute_behavior` (String) The behavior to exhibit for modify and modify DN operations that update one or more of the source attributes used in any of the value patterns.
- `update_target_attribute_behavior` (String) The behavior to exhibit for modify and modify DN operations that attempt to update the set of values for the target attribute.
- `updated_entry_newly_matches_criteria_behavior` (String) The behavior to exhibit for modify or modify DN operations that update an entry that previously did not satisfy either the base DN or filter criteria, but now do satisfy that criteria.
- `updated_entry_no_longer_matches_criteria_behavior` (String) The behavior to exhibit for modify or modify DN operations that update an entry that previously satisfied the base DN and filter criteria, but now no longer satisfies that criteria.
- `upper_bound` (Number) Specifies the upper bound for the numeric value which will be inserted into the search filter.
- `user_mapping_local_attribute` (Set of String) The names of the attributes in the local user entry whose values must match the values of the corresponding fields in the PingOne service.
- `user_mapping_remote_json_field` (Set of String) The names of the fields in the PingOne service whose values must match the values of the corresponding attributes in the local user entry, as specified in the user-mapping-local-attribute property.
- `value_pattern` (Set of String) Specifies a pattern for constructing the values to use for the target attribute type.
