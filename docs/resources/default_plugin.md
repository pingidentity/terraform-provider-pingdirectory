<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of this config object.

### Optional

- `additional_user_mapping_scim_filter` (String) An optional SCIM filter that will be ANDed with the filter created to identify the account in the PingOne service that corresponds to the local entry. Only the "eq", "sw", "and", and "or" filter types may be used.
- `agentx_address` (String) The hostname or IP address of the SNMP master agent.
- `agentx_port` (Number) The port number on which the SNMP master agent will be contacted.
- `allow_lax_pass_through_authentication_passwords` (Boolean) Indicates whether to overwrite the user's local password even if the password used to authenticate to the PingOne service would have failed validation if the user attempted to set it directly.
- `allowed_request_control` (Set of String) Specifies the OIDs of the controls that are allowed to be present in operations to coalesce. These controls are passed through when the request is validated, but they will not be included when the background thread applies the coalesced modify requests.
- `always_map_responses` (Boolean) Indicates whether DNs in response messages containing the target DN should always be remapped back to the source DN. If this is "false", then mapping will be performed for a response message only if one or more elements of the associated request are mapped. Otherwise, the mapping will be performed for all responses regardless of whether the mapping was applied to the request.
- `api_url` (String) Specifies the API endpoint for the PingOne web service.
- `append` (Boolean) Specifies whether to append to existing log files.
- `attribute_type` (Set of String) Specifies the name or OID of an attribute type for which values should be checked to ensure that they are 7-bit clean.
- `auth_url` (String) Specifies the API endpoint for the PingOne authentication service.
- `base_dn` (Set of String) A base DN that may be used to identify entries that should support the ds-pwp-modifiable-state-json operational attribute.
- `bind_dn_pattern` (String) A pattern to use to construct the bind DN for the simple bind request to send to the remote server. This may consist of a combination of static text and attribute values and other directives enclosed in curly braces.  For example, the value "cn={cn},ou=People,dc=example,dc=com" indicates that the remote bind DN should be constructed from the text "cn=" followed by the value of the local entry's cn attribute followed by the text "ou=People,dc=example,dc=com". If an attribute contains the value to use as the bind DN for pass-through authentication, then the pattern may simply be the name of that attribute in curly braces (e.g., if the seeAlso attribute contains the bind DN for the target user, then a bind DN pattern of "{seeAlso}" would be appropriate).  Note that a bind DN pattern can be used to construct a bind DN that is not actually a valid LDAP distinguished name. For example, if authentication is being passed through to a Microsoft Active Directory server, then a bind DN pattern could be used to construct a user principal name (UPN) as an alternative to a distinguished name.
- `changelog_password_encryption_key` (String, Sensitive) A passphrase that may be used to generate the key for encrypting passwords stored in the changelog. The same passphrase also needs to be set (either through the "changelog-password-decryption-key" property or the "changelog-password-decryption-key-passphrase-provider" property) in the Global Sync Configuration in the Data Sync Server.
- `changelog_password_encryption_key_passphrase_provider` (String) A passphrase provider that may be used to obtain the passphrase that will be used to generate the key for encrypting passwords stored in the changelog. The same passphrase also needs to be set (either through the "changelog-password-decryption-key" property or the "changelog-password-decryption-key-passphrase-provider" property) in the Global Sync Configuration in the Data Sync Server.
- `collection_interval` (String) Some of the calculated statistics, such as the average and maximum queue sizes, can use multiple samples within a log interval. This value controls how often samples are gathered, and setting this value too small can have an adverse impact on performance.

For example, "(mail={uid:ldapFilterEscape}@example.com)" would construct a search filter to search for a user whose entry in the local server contains a uid attribute whose value appears before "@example.com" in the mail attribute in the external server. Note that the "ldapFilterEscape" modifier should almost always be used with attributes specified in the pattern.
