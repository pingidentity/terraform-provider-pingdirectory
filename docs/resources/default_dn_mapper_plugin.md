## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Name of this object.

### Optional

- `always_map_responses` (Boolean) Indicates whether DNs in response messages containing the target DN should always be remapped back to the source DN. If this is "false", then mapping will be performed for a response message only if one or more elements of the associated request are mapped. Otherwise, the mapping will be performed for all responses regardless of whether the mapping was applied to the request.

- `enable_attribute_mapping` (Boolean) Indicates whether DN mapping should be applied to the values of attributes with appropriate syntaxes.

- `invoke_for_internal_operations` (Boolean) Indicates whether the plug-in should be invoked for internal operations.
- `map_attribute` (Set of String) Specifies a set of specific attributes for which DN mapping should be applied. This will only be applicable if the enable-attribute-mapping property has a value of "true". Any attributes listed must be defined in the server schema with either the distinguished name syntax or the name and optional UID syntax.
- `plugin_type` (Set of String) Specifies the set of plug-in types for the plug-in, which specifies the times at which the plug-in is invoked.
- `source_dn` (String) Specifies the source DN that may appear in client requests which should be remapped to the target DN. Note that the source DN must not be equal to the target DN.
