# pingdirectory_file_based_access_log_publisher (Resource)

Manages a File Based Access Log Publisher.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.1"
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      version = "~> 0.3.0"
      source  = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
  product_version        = "9.2.0.0"
}

# Use "pingdirectory_default_file_based_access_log_publisher" if you are adopting existing configuration from the PingDirectory server into Terraform
resource "pingdirectory_file_based_access_log_publisher" "myFileBasedAccessLogPublisher" {
  id                   = "MyFileBasedAccessLogPublisher"
  log_file             = "logs/example.log"
  log_file_permissions = "600"
  rotation_policy      = ["Size Limit Rotation Policy"]
  retention_policy     = ["File Count Retention Policy"]
  asynchronous         = true
  enabled              = false
}

## Schema

### Required

- `enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the Log Publisher is enabled for use.
- `id` (String) Name of this object.
- `log_file` (String) The file name to use for the log files generated by the File Based Access Log Publisher. The path to the file can be specified either as relative to the server root or as an absolute path.

### Optional

- `append` (Boolean) Specifies whether to append to existing log files.
- `asynchronous` (Boolean) Indicates whether the Writer Based Access Log Publisher will publish records asynchronously.
- `auto_flush` (Boolean) Specifies whether to flush the writer after every log record.
- `buffer_size` (String) Specifies the log file buffer size.
- `compression_mechanism` (String) Specifies the type of compression (if any) to use for log files that are written.
- `connection_criteria` (String) Specifies a set of connection criteria that must match the associated client connection in order for a connect, disconnect, request, or result message to be logged.
- `correlate_requests_and_results` (Boolean) Indicates whether to automatically log result messages for any operation in which the corresponding request was logged. In such cases, the result, entry, and reference criteria will be ignored, although the log-responses, log-search-entries, and log-search-references properties will be honored.
- `description` (String) A description for this Log Publisher
- `encrypt_log` (Boolean) Indicates whether log files should be encrypted so that their content is not available to unauthorized users.
- `encryption_settings_definition_id` (String) Specifies the ID of the encryption settings definition that should be used to encrypt the data. If this is not provided, the server's preferred encryption settings definition will be used. The "encryption-settings list" command can be used to obtain a list of the encryption settings definitions available in the server.
- `generify_message_strings_when_possible` (Boolean) Indicates whether to use generified version of certain message strings, including diagnostic messages, additional information messages, authentication failure reasons, and disconnect messages. Generified versions of those strings may use placeholders (like %s for a string or %d for an integer) rather than the version of the string with those placeholders replaced with specific values.
- `include_add_attribute_names` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages for add requests should include a list of the names of the attributes included in the entry to add.
- `include_extended_search_request_details` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages for search requests should include extended information from the request, including the requested size limit, time limit, alias dereferencing behavior, and types only behavior.
- `include_instance_name` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages should include the instance name for the Directory Server.
- `include_modify_attribute_names` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages for modify requests should include a list of the names of the attributes to be modified.
- `include_product_name` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages should include the product name for the Directory Server.
- `include_replication_change_id` (Boolean) Indicates whether to log information about the replication change ID.
- `include_request_controls` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages for operation requests should include a list of the OIDs of any controls included in the request.
- `include_request_details_in_intermediate_response_messages` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages for intermediate responses should include information about the associated operation request.
- `include_request_details_in_result_messages` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages for operation results should include information about both the request and the result.
- `include_request_details_in_search_entry_messages` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages for search result entries should include information about the associated search request.
- `include_request_details_in_search_reference_messages` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages for search result references should include information about the associated search request.
- `include_requester_dn` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages for operation requests should include the DN of the authenticated user for the client connection on which the operation was requested.
- `include_requester_ip_address` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages for operation requests should include the IP address of the client that requested the operation.
- `include_response_controls` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages for operation results should include a list of the OIDs of any controls included in the result.
- `include_result_code_names` (Boolean) Indicates whether result log messages should include human-readable names for result codes in addition to their numeric values.
- `include_search_entry_attribute_names` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages for search result entries should include a list of the names of the attributes included in the entry that was returned.
- `include_startup_id` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages should include the startup ID for the Directory Server, which is a value assigned to the server instance at startup and may be used to identify when the server has been restarted.
- `include_thread_id` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages should include the thread ID for the Directory Server in each log message. This ID can be used to correlate log messages from the same thread within a single log as well as generated by the same thread across different types of log files. More information about the thread with a specific ID can be obtained using the cn=JVM Stack Trace,cn=monitor entry.
