# pingdirectory_default_scim_attribute_mapping (Resource)

Manages a Scim Attribute Mapping.

SCIM Attribute Mappings define a mapping between SCIM Resource Type attributes and LDAP attributes.

Since this is a 'default' resource, the managed object must already exist in the PingDirectory configuration.
