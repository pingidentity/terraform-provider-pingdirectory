# pingdirectory_aggregate_identity_mapper (Resource)

Manages a Aggregate Identity Mapper.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      source = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
}

resource "pingdirectory_aggregate_identity_mapper" "myAggregateIdentityMapper" {
  id      = "MyAggregateIdentityMapper"
  enabled = false
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the Identity Mapper is enabled for use.
- `id` (String) Name of this object.

### Optional

- `all_included_identity_mapper` (Set of String) The set of identity mappers that must all match the target entry. Each identity mapper must uniquely match the same target entry. If any of the identity mappers match multiple entries, if any of them match zero entries, or if any of them match different entries, then the mapping will fail.
- `any_included_identity_mapper` (Set of String) The set of identity mappers that will be used to identify the target entry. At least one identity mapper must uniquely match an entry. If multiple identity mappers match entries, then they must all uniquely match the same entry. If none of the identity mappers match any entries, if any of them match multiple entries, or if any of them match different entries, then the mapping will fail.
- `description` (String) A description for this Identity Mapper

### Read-Only

- `last_updated` (String) Timestamp of the last Terraform update of this resource.
- `notifications` (Set of String) Notifications returned by the PingDirectory Configuration API.
- `required_actions` (Set of Object) Required actions returned by the PingDirectory Configuration API. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--required_actions))

<a id="nestedatt--required_actions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `required_actions`

Read-Only:

- `property` (String)
- `synopsis` (String)
- `type` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# "aggregateIdentityMapperId" should be the id of the Aggregate Identity Mapper to be imported
terraform import pingdirectory_aggregate_identity_mapper.myAggregateIdentityMapper aggregateIdentityMapperId
```
