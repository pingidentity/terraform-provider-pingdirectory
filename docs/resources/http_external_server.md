# pingdirectory_http_external_server (Resource)

Manages a Http External Server.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      source = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
}

# Use "pingdirectory_default_http_external_server" if you are adopting existing configuration from the PingDirectory server into Terraform
resource "pingdirectory_http_external_server" "myHttpExternalServer" {
  id       = "MyHttpExternalServer"
  base_url = "example.com"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `base_url` (String) The base URL of the external server, optionally including port number, for example "https://externalService:9031".
- `id` (String) Name of this object.

### Optional

- `connect_timeout` (String) Specifies the maximum length of time to wait for a connection to be established before aborting a request to the server.
- `description` (String) A description for this External Server
- `hostname_verification_method` (String) The mechanism for checking if the hostname of the HTTP External Server matches the name(s) stored inside the server's X.509 certificate. This is only applicable if SSL is being used for connection security.
- `key_manager_provider` (String) The key manager provider to use if SSL (HTTPS) is to be used for connection-level security. When specifying a value for this property (except when using the Null key manager provider) you must ensure that the external server trusts this server's public certificate by adding this server's public certificate to the external server's trust store.
- `response_timeout` (String) Specifies the maximum length of time to wait for response data to be read from an established connection before aborting a request to the server.
- `ssl_cert_nickname` (String) The certificate alias within the keystore to use if SSL (HTTPS) is to be used for connection-level security. When specifying a value for this property you must ensure that the external server trusts this server's public certificate by adding this server's public certificate to the external server's trust store.
- `trust_manager_provider` (String) The trust manager provider to use if SSL (HTTPS) is to be used for connection-level security.

### Read-Only

- `last_updated` (String) Timestamp of the last Terraform update of this resource.
- `notifications` (Set of String) Notifications returned by the PingDirectory Configuration API.
- `required_actions` (Set of Object) Required actions returned by the PingDirectory Configuration API. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--required_actions))
