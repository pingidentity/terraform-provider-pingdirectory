# pingdirectory_cipher_stream_provider (Resource)

Manages a Cipher Stream Provider.

Cipher Stream Providers are used to obtain cipher input and output streams which may be used to read and write encrypted data.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingdirectory_cipher_stream_provider" "myCipherStreamProvider" {
  name                   = "MyCipherStreamProvider"
  type                   = "amazon-key-management-service"
  kms_encryption_key_arn = "my_example_Encryption_Key"
  enabled                = false
}
```

- `type` (String) The type of Cipher Stream Provider resource. Options are ['amazon-key-management-service', 'amazon-secrets-manager', 'azure-key-vault', 'file-based', 'wait-for-passphrase', 'conjur', 'pkcs11', 'vault', 'third-party']

### Optional

  - `file-based`: The path to a file that will hold metadata about the encryption performed by this File Based Cipher Stream Provider.
  - `conjur`: The path to a file that will hold metadata about the encryption performed by this Conjur Cipher Stream Provider.
  - `pkcs11`: The path to a file that will hold metadata about the encryption performed by this PKCS11 Cipher Stream Provider.
- `extension_argument` (Set of String) The set of arguments used to customize the behavior for the Third Party Cipher Stream Provider. Each configuration property should be given in the form 'name=value'.
- `extension_class` (String) The fully-qualified name of the Java class providing the logic for the Third Party Cipher Stream Provider.
- `http_proxy_external_server` (String) Supported in PingDirectory product version 9.2.0.0+. A reference to an HTTP proxy server that should be used for requests sent to the Azure service.
- `iteration_count` (Number) Supported in PingDirectory product version 9.3.0.0+. The PBKDF2 iteration count that will be used when deriving the encryption key used to protect the encryption settings database.
- `key_store_pin` (String, Sensitive) The clear-text user PIN needed to interact with the PKCS #11 token.
- `key_store_pin_environment_variable` (String) The name of an environment variable whose value is the user PIN needed to interact with the PKCS #11 token. The environment variable must be defined and must contain a clear-text representation of the PIN.
- `key_store_pin_file` (String) The path to a file containing the user PIN needed to interact with the PKCS #11 token. The file must exist and must contain exactly one line with a clear-text representation of the PIN.
- `key_vault_uri` (String) The URI that identifies the Azure Key Vault from which the secret is to be retrieved.
- `key_wrapping_transformation` (String) Supported in PingDirectory product version 10.1.0.0+. The cipher transformation that will be used to wrap and unwrap the encryption key. If no key wrapping transformation is defined, then the server will select a transformation based on the type of certificate being used.
- `kms_encryption_key_arn` (String) The Amazon resource name (ARN) for the KMS key that will be used to encrypt the contents of the passphrase file. This key must exist, and the AWS client must have access to encrypt and decrypt data using this key.
- `password_file` (String) The path to the file containing the password to use when generating ciphers.
- `pkcs11_key_store_type` (String) The key store type to use when obtaining an instance of a key store for interacting with a PKCS #11 token.
- `pkcs11_provider_class` (String) The fully-qualified name of the Java security provider class that implements support for interacting with PKCS #11 tokens.
- `pkcs11_provider_configuration_file` (String) The path to the file to use to configure the security provider that implements support for interacting with PKCS #11 tokens.
- `secret_field_name` (String) The name of the JSON field whose value is the passphrase that will be used to generate the encryption key for protecting the contents of the encryption settings database.
- `secret_id` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the user-friendly name of the secret to be retrieved.
- `secret_name` (String) The name of the secret to retrieve.
- `secret_version_id` (String) The unique identifier for the version of the secret to be retrieved.
- `secret_version_stage` (String) The staging label for the version of the secret to be retrieved.
- `ssl_cert_nickname` (String) The alias for the certificate in the PKCS #11 token that will be used to wrap the encryption key. The target certificate must exist in the PKCS #11 token, and it must have an RSA key pair because the JVM does not currently provide adequate key wrapping support for elliptic curve key pairs.  If you have also configured the server to use a PKCS #11 token for accessing listener certificates, we strongly recommend that you use a different certificate to protect the contents of the encryption settings database than you use for negotiating TLS sessions with clients. It is imperative that the certificate used by this PKCS11 Cipher Stream Provider remain constant for the life of the provider because if the certificate were to be replaced, then the contents of the encryption settings database could become inaccessible. Unlike with listener certificates used for TLS negotiation that need to be replaced on a regular basis, this PKCS11 Cipher Stream Provider does not consider the validity period for the associated certificate, and it will continue to function even after the certificate has expired.  If you need to rotate the certificate used to protect the server's encryption settings database, you should first install the desired new certificate in the PKCS #11 token under a different alias. Then, you should create a new instance of this PKCS11 Cipher Stream Provider that is configured to use that certificate, and that also uses a different value for the encryption-metadata-file because the information in that file is tied to the certificate used to generate it. Finally, you will need to update the global configuration so that the encryption-settings-cipher-stream-provider property references the new cipher stream provider rather than this one. The update to the global configuration must be done with the server online so that it can properly re-encrypt the contents of the encryption settings database with the correct key tied to the new certificate.
- `trust_store_file` (String) The path to a file containing the information needed to trust the certificate presented by the Vault servers.
- `trust_store_pin` (String, Sensitive) The passphrase needed to access the contents of the trust store. This is only required if a trust store file is required, and if that trust store requires a PIN to access its contents.
- `trust_store_type` (String) The store type for the specified trust store file. The value should likely be one of "JKS" or "PKCS12".
- `vault_authentication_method` (String) The mechanism used to authenticate to the Vault server.
- `vault_encryption_metadata_file` (String) The path to a file that will hold metadata about the encryption performed by this Vault Cipher Stream Provider.
- `vault_external_server` (String) An external server definition with information needed to connect and authenticate to the Vault server.
- `vault_secret_field_name` (String) The name of the field in the Vault secret record that contains the passphrase to use to generate the encryption key.
- `vault_secret_path` (String) The path to the desired secret in the Vault service. This will be appended to the value of the base-url property for the associated Vault external server.
- `vault_server_base_uri` (Set of String) The base URL needed to access the Vault server. The base URL should consist of the protocol ("http" or "https"), the server address (resolvable name or IP address), and the port number. For example, "https://vault.example.com:8200/".
- `wait_for_password_file` (Boolean) Indicates whether the server should wait for the password file to become available if it does not exist.
