<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Name of this object.

### Optional

- `append` (Boolean) Specifies whether to append to existing log files.
- `asynchronous` (Boolean) Indicates whether the File Based JSON HTTP Operation Log Publisher will publish records asynchronously.
- `auto_flush` (Boolean) Specifies whether to flush the writer after every log record.
- `buffer_size` (String) Specifies the log file buffer size.
- `compression_mechanism` (String) Specifies the type of compression (if any) to use for log files that are written.
- `description` (String) A description for this Log Publisher
- `enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the Log Publisher is enabled for use.
- `encrypt_log` (Boolean) Indicates whether log files should be encrypted so that their content is not available to unauthorized users.
- `encryption_settings_definition_id` (String) Specifies the ID of the encryption settings definition that should be used to encrypt the data. If this is not provided, the server's preferred encryption settings definition will be used. The "encryption-settings list" command can be used to obtain a list of the encryption settings definitions available in the server.
- `include_instance_name` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages should include the instance name for the Directory Server.
- `include_product_name` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages should include the product name for the Directory Server.
- `include_request_details_in_result_messages` (Boolean) Indicates whether result log messages should include all of the elements of request log messages. This may be used to record a single message per operation with details about both the request and response.
- `include_startup_id` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages should include the startup ID for the Directory Server, which is a value assigned to the server instance at startup and may be used to identify when the server has been restarted.
- `include_thread_id` (Boolean) Indicates whether log messages should include the thread ID for the Directory Server in each log message. This ID can be used to correlate log messages from the same thread within a single log as well as generated by the same thread across different types of log files. More information about the thread with a specific ID can be obtained using the cn=JVM Stack Trace,cn=monitor entry.
- `log_file` (String) The file name to use for the log files generated by the File Based JSON HTTP Operation Log Publisher. The path to the file can be specified either as relative to the server root or as an absolute path.
- `log_file_permissions` (String) The UNIX permissions of the log files created by this File Based JSON HTTP Operation Log Publisher.
- `log_redirect_uri` (Boolean) Indicates whether the redirect URI (i.e., the value of the "Location" header from responses) should be included in response log messages.
- `log_request_authorization_type` (Boolean) Indicates whether to log the type of credentials given if an "Authorization" header was included in the request. Logging the authorization type may be useful, and is much more secure than logging the entire value of the "Authorization" header.
- `log_request_cookie_names` (Boolean) Indicates whether to log the names of any cookies included in an HTTP request. Logging cookie names may be useful and is much more secure than logging the entire content of the cookies (which may include sensitive information).
- `log_request_headers` (String) Indicates whether request log messages should include information about HTTP headers included in the request.
- `log_request_parameters` (String) Indicates what (if any) information about request parameters should be included in request log messages. Note that this will only be used for requests with a method other than GET, since GET request parameters will be included in the request URL.
- `log_request_protocol` (Boolean) Indicates whether request log messages should include information about the HTTP version specified in the request.
- `log_requests` (Boolean) Indicates whether to record a log message with information about requests received from the client.
- `log_response_cookie_names` (Boolean) Indicates whether to log the names of any cookies set in an HTTP response. Logging cookie names may be useful and is much more secure than logging the entire content of the cookies (which may include sensitive information).
- `log_response_headers` (String) Indicates whether response log messages should include information about HTTP headers included in the response.
- `log_results` (Boolean) Indicates whether to record a log message with information about the result of processing a requested HTTP operation.
- `logging_error_behavior` (String) Specifies the behavior that the server should exhibit if an error occurs during logging processing.
- `queue_size` (Number) The maximum number of log records that can be stored in the asynchronous queue.
- `retention_policy` (Set of String) The retention policy to use for the File Based JSON HTTP Operation Log Publisher .
- `rotation_listener` (Set of String) A listener that should be notified whenever a log file is rotated out of service.
- `rotation_policy` (Set of String) The rotation policy to use for the File Based JSON HTTP Operation Log Publisher .
- `sign_log` (Boolean) Indicates whether the log should be cryptographically signed so that the log content cannot be altered in an undetectable manner.
- `suppressed_request_header_name` (Set of String) Specifies the case-insensitive names of request headers that should be omitted from log messages (e.g., for the purpose of brevity or security). This will only be used if the log-request-headers property has a value of true.
- `suppressed_request_parameter_name` (Set of String) Specifies the case-insensitive names of request parameters that should be omitted from log messages (e.g., for the purpose of brevity or security). This will only be used if the log-request-parameters property has a value of parameter-names or parameter-names-and-values.
- `suppressed_response_header_name` (Set of String) Specifies the case-insensitive names of response headers that should be omitted from log messages (e.g., for the purpose of brevity or security). This will only be used if the log-response-headers property has a value of true.
- `time_interval` (String) Specifies the interval at which to check whether the log files need to be rotated.
- `write_multi_line_messages` (Boolean) Indicates whether the JSON objects should use a multi-line representation (with each object field and array value on its own line) that may be easier for administrators to read, but each message will be larger (because of additional spaces and end-of-line markers), and it may be more difficult to consume and parse through some text-oriented tools.
