## Schema

### Required

### Optional

- `account_creation_notification_request_criteria` (String) A request criteria object that identifies which add requests should result in account creation notifications for this handler.
- `account_update_notification_request_criteria` (String) A request criteria object that identifies which modify and modify DN requests should result in account update notifications for this handler.
- `asynchronous` (Boolean) Indicates whether the server should attempt to invoke this Account Status Notification Handler in a background thread so that any potentially-expensive processing (e.g., performing network communication to deliver a message) will not delay processing for the operation that triggered the notification.
- `description` (String) A description for this Account Status Notification Handler
- `email_address_attribute_type` (Set of String) Specifies which attribute in the user's entries may be used to obtain the email address when notifying the end user.
- `email_address_json_field` (String) The name of the JSON field whose value is the email address to which the message should be sent. The email address must be contained in a top-level field whose value is a single string.
- `email_address_json_object_filter` (String) A JSON object filter that may be used to identify which email address value to use when sending the message.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the Account Status Notification Handler is enabled. Only enabled handlers are invoked whenever a related event occurs in the server.

- `message_template_file` (Set of String) Specifies the path to the file containing the message template to generate the email notification messages.
- `recipient_address` (Set of String) Specifies an email address to which notification messages are sent, either instead of or in addition to the end user for whom the notification has been generated.
- `send_message_without_end_user_address` (Boolean) Indicates whether an email notification message should be generated and sent to the set of notification recipients even if the user entry does not contain any values for any of the email address attributes (that is, in cases when it is not possible to notify the end user).
- `sender_address` (String) Specifies the email address from which the message is sent. Note that this does not necessarily have to be a legitimate email address.
