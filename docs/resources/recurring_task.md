# pingdirectory_recurring_task (Resource)

Manages a Recurring Task.

Recurring Tasks encapsulate the information to be included in administrative tasks that are to be invoked on a recurring basis within the server. Recurring Tasks must be included in a recurring task chain to actually be scheduled for processing.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "pingdirectory_recurring_task" "myRecurringTask" {
  name                          = "MyRecurringTask"
  type                          = "generate-server-profile"
  profile_directory             = "/opt/out/instance"
  retain_previous_profile_count = 10
}
```
