# pingdirectory_external_server (Resource)

Manages a External Server.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.1"
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      version = "~> 0.3.0"
      source  = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
  product_version        = "9.3.0.0"
}

resource "pingdirectory_external_server" "myExternalServer" {
  id               = "MyExternalServer"
  type             = "smtp"
  server_host_name = "mysmtp.mailserver.com"
  server_port      = 25
}

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Name of this object.
- `type` (String) The type of External Server resource. Options are ['smtp', 'nokia-ds', 'ping-identity-ds', 'active-directory', 'jdbc', 'syslog', 'ping-identity-proxy-server', 'http-proxy', 'nokia-proxy-server', 'opendj', 'ldap', 'ping-one-http', 'http', 'oracle-unified-directory', 'conjur', 'amazon-aws', 'vault']

### Optional

- `abandon_on_timeout` (Boolean) Indicates whether to send an abandon request for an operation for which a response timeout is encountered. A request which has timed out on one server may be retried on another server regardless of whether an abandon request is sent, but if the initial attempt is not abandoned then a long-running operation may unnecessarily continue to consume processing resources on the initial server.
- `authentication_method` (String) The mechanism to use to authenticate to the target server.
- `aws_access_key_id` (String) The access key ID that will be used if authentication should use an access key. If this is provided, then an aws-secret-access-key must also be provided.
- `aws_region_name` (String) The name of the AWS region containing the resources that will be accessed.
- `aws_secret_access_key` (String, Sensitive) The secret access key that will be used if authentication should use an access key. If this is provided, then an aws-access-key-id must also be provided.
- `base_url` (String) The base URL of the external server, optionally including port number, for example "https://externalService:9031".
- `basic_authentication_passphrase_provider` (String) A passphrase provider that provides access to the password to use to authenticate to the HTTP Proxy External Server.
- `basic_authentication_username` (String) The username to use to authenticate to the HTTP Proxy External Server.
- `bind_dn` (String) The DN to use to bind to the target LDAP server if simple authentication is required.
- `conjur_account_name` (String) The name of the account with which the desired secrets are associated.
- `conjur_authentication_method` (String) The mechanism used to authenticate to the Conjur server.
- `conjur_server_base_uri` (Set of String) The base URL needed to access the CyberArk Conjur server. The base URL should consist of the protocol ("http" or "https"), the server address (resolvable name or IP address), and the port number. For example, "https://conjur.example.com:8443/".
- `connect_timeout` (String) Specifies the maximum length of time to wait for a connection to be established before giving up and considering the server unavailable.
- `connection_security` (String) The mechanism to use to secure communication with the directory server.
- `database_name` (String) Specifies which database to connect to. This is ignored if jdbc-driver-url is specified.
- `defunct_connection_result_code` (Set of String) Specifies the operation result code values that should cause the associated connection should be considered defunct. If an operation fails with one of these result codes, then it will be terminated and an attempt will be made to establish a new connection in its place.
- `description` (String) A description for this External Server
- `health_check_connect_timeout` (String) Specifies the maximum length of time to wait for a connection to be established for the purpose of performing a health check. If the connection cannot be established within this length of time, the server will be classified as unavailable.
- `hostname_verification_method` (String) The mechanism for checking if the hostname in the PingOne ID Token Validator's base-url value matches the name(s) stored inside the X.509 certificate presented by PingOne.
- `http_proxy_external_server` (String) A reference to an HTTP proxy server that should be used for requests sent to the AWS service. Supported in PingDirectory product version 9.2.0.0+.
- `initial_connections` (Number) The number of connections to initially establish to the LDAP external server. A value of zero indicates that the number of connections should be dynamically based on the number of available worker threads. This will be ignored when using a thread-local connection pool.
- `jdbc_connection_properties` (Set of String) Specifies the connection properties for the JDBC datasource.
- `jdbc_driver_type` (String) Specifies a supported database driver type. The driver class will be automatically selected based on this selection. We highly recommend using a JDBC 4 driver that is suitable for the current Java platform.
- `jdbc_driver_url` (String) Specify the complete JDBC URL which will be used instead of the automatic URL format. You must select type 'other' for the jdbc-driver-type.
- `key_manager_provider` (String) The key manager provider to use if SSL or StartTLS is to be used for connection-level security. When specifying a value for this property (except when using the Null key manager provider) you must ensure that the external server trusts this server's public certificate by adding this server's public certificate to the external server's trust store.
- `location` (String) Specifies the location for the LDAP External Server.
- `max_connection_age` (String) Specifies the maximum length of time that connections to this server should be allowed to remain established before being closed and replaced with newly-established connections.
- `max_connections` (Number) The maximum number of concurrent connections to maintain for the LDAP external server. A value of zero indicates that the number of connections should be dynamically based on the number of available worker threads. This will be ignored when using a thread-local connection pool.
- `max_response_size` (String) Specifies the maximum response size that should be supported for messages received from the LDAP external server.
- `min_expired_connection_disconnect_interval` (String) Specifies the minimum length of time that should pass between connection closures as a result of the connections being established for longer than the maximum connection age.
