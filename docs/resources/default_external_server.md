## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of this config object.

### Optional

- `abandon_on_timeout` (Boolean) Indicates whether to send an abandon request for an operation for which a response timeout is encountered. A request which has timed out on one server may be retried on another server regardless of whether an abandon request is sent, but if the initial attempt is not abandoned then a long-running operation may unnecessarily continue to consume processing resources on the initial server.
