# pingdirectory_default_delegated_admin_attribute_category (Resource)

Manages a Delegated Admin Attribute Category.

A Delegated Admin Attribute Category defines a collection of attributes which belong together. Attributes in the same Delegated Admin Attribute Category are grouped together when displayed to the end user.

Since this is a 'default' resource, the managed object must already exist in the PingDirectory configuration.
