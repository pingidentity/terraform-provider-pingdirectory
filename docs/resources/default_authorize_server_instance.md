# pingdirectory_default_authorize_server_instance (Resource)

Manages a Authorize Server Instance.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.1"
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      version = "~> 0.3.0"
      source  = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
  product_version        = "9.2.0.0"
}

resource "pingdirectory_default_authorize_server_instance" "myAuthorizeServerInstance" {
  id                   = "MyAuthorizeServerInstance"
  server_instance_name = "instance-name"
  server_version       = "9.2.0.0"
}
```

- `http_port` (Number) The TCP port on which this server is listening for HTTP connections.
- `https_port` (Number) The TCP port on which this server is listening for HTTPS connections.
- `inter_server_certificate` (String) The public component of the certificate used by this instance to protect inter-server communication and to perform server-specific encryption. This will generally be managed by the server and should only be altered by administrators under explicit direction from Ping Identity support personnel.

- `server_instance_location` (String) Specifies the location for the Server Instance.
- `server_instance_name` (String) The name of this Server Instance. The instance name needs to be unique if this server will be part of a topology of servers that are connected to each other. Once set, it may not be changed.
- `server_instance_type` (String) Specifies the type of server installation.
- `server_root` (String) The file system path where this Server Instance is installed.
- `server_version` (String) The version of the server.
- `start_tls_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether StartTLS is enabled on this server.

### Read-Only

- `last_updated` (String) Timestamp of the last Terraform update of this resource.
